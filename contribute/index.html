    <h1>Contributing</h1>
    <p>
      So you've got an awesome idea about a tutorial. Good! This guide
      will let you know all the things you need, and help you through the process
      of making great tutorials for the community.
    </p>

    <h1>How this Website works?</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Moroccan Rubyist</strong> is hosted on 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
      and lives in a public repository that anyone can see and contribute to its code.
      So the first thing you might want to do is to
      create a new GitHub account if you don't already have one,
      and then fork the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MoroccanRubyist/moroccanrubyist.github.io">
        Website's repository.
      </a> 
      You can refer back to
      <a target="_blank" href="http://help.github.com/">GitHub Help</a> to learn more
      about <a target="_blank" href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and how to work with
      repositories.
    </p>
    <img src="/images/contribution/mrrepository.png" alt="Moroccan Rubyist's GitHub repository">
    <p>
      This Website runs on <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>,
      a static Websites and blogs generator and also the main engine behind
      <a target="_blank" href="http://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>.
      You can read a bit of
      <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll's documentation</a>
      in order to have better understanding of how the parts of this Website work. But don't worry,
      you don't have to read the whole thing to start contributing.
    </p>

    <h1>Writing new posts</h1>
    <p>
      Once you're done forking the
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/MoroccanRubyist/moroccanrubyist.github.io">
        Website's repository
      </a>
      and cloning it to your local machine, you're now ready to start writing new posts.
      As you might have noticed, the repository contains a directory called "_posts",
      this is the directory where all posts live. Let's take a look at what's inside a post file!

    <p>
      You should have known what's this at first glance if you've already read
      <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/">Jekyll's documentation</a>!
      Yes, it's a <a target="_blank" href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a> front-matter block.
      It's used to set some post variables that will be rendered by
      <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> into our static HTML pages
      using the <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid">Liquid</a>
      templating language. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Your posts must always start with a block like the one above, but
      don't forget to update those variables with your own information!
      Spend some time making a beautiful 200x200px thumbnail picture for you post,
      thumbnails are placed in the "/images/thumbnails" directory.
      You can include one Youtube video in your post. If you don't want that, you should
      remove the "youtube" variable from the front-matter block.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest of your post can be written in either
      <a target="_blank" href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> or
      <a target="_blank" href="http://textile.sitemonks.com/">Textile</a>, use the one you feel more
      comfortable with. You may come to some places in your tutorial where you'll want
      to include some code snippets, you can do this by writing your code between those two
      <a target="_blank" href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Liquid">Liquid</a> tags:
    </p>
    <img src="/images/contribution/syntaxtags.png" alt="Liquid syntax highlighting tags">
    <p>
      You may also want to include some images, just create a new directory for you post's
      images inside "/images" directory and drop them all there. Then use your preferred markup
      language to include them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, your post's filename must be in a special format so that 
      <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>
      can render it properly. So make sure to name your post like this:
    </p>
    {% highlight html %}
EAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP

Examples:
  2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.markdown
  2012-09-12-how-to-write-a-blog.textile
    {% endhighlight %}
    <p>
      You're good to go now. It's time to start writing your next greatest tutorial!
      I'll be waiting for your pull requests :)
